### Write methode that take an array as a parameter then we must reverse and print this array.

## White board process

## Approach & Efficiency
### I used for loop to solve this challenge by through over all elemnt in array start from last elemnt and so, in the first I faced problem in matching the output as array like that [x,y,...etc] but is solved this probelm by using some if statement and sout line.

### Big O
- time O(N) => The execution time of the code is directly proportional to the size of the input
