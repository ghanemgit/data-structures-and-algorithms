# Binary Search of Sorted Array
## Problem domain

### Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
### I built a step-by-step algorithm as shown in the whiteboard and followed it to solve the problem, The Big O notation for Binary Search is O(log N). In contrast to O(N) which takes an additional step for each data element, O(log N) means that the algorithm takes an additional step each time the data doubles.
